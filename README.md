# MiLang

The language by a crazy man, because he wanted to.

# What the langeuage shall be

## Functional core

Side effects are not done within actors themselves, but by calling out
to 'commands'. commands then report back to the actors.

## Actor Centric

Each module can be an actor, that can create other actors, or exit, at
any time.

## Regular

There shall be 1, and only 1, way to express the vast majority of ideas.
This means that rather than a function being declarable differently 
depending on if it is anonymouse or not, there is only 1 way to do it.
Symbols have exactly 1 way to be written, and so forth.

## Erlang runtime

Because I'm lazy.

# The language proper

Is a work in progress. What was here was wrong by the time it got pushed.
