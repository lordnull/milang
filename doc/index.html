	<h1>What</h1>
	<p>MiLang is meant to remove syntax and type errors. It does this by using a visual programming enviroment, pragmatically functional modality, and static typing.</p>
	<h1>Other goals</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Diffs on the generated source code must be readable by a human. This means the visual ide part cannot contain superfluous stuff like positioning.</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>The lanuage</h1>
	<p>The language doesn't need to be easy to write, but being boiler-plate heavy will make it hard to read. Ease of parsing is also a high priority.</p>
	<p>Likely the easiest path is 'prefix keyword' style.</p>
